    Requirements
      Although you have freedom to design this site as you wish, you must adhere to the requirements specified below. Some criteria are purely numeric or binary (you either met it or didn't), while others are more qualitative in nature (varying in degree).

    Technical Components
      Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.
      report.html does not count toward the five, but index.html does.

      Answer : I have 6 pages, each being connected by a navigation bar. If the desired site's button is clicked on the nav bar, it will take you to the site.
      The 6 pages include a home page (index.html), a book list (books.html), a schdeule (schedule.html), a members page (members.html), a getting started page (get-started.html),
      and a "thank you for joining us" page (thanks.html).

      Each page must declare its favicon (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).

      Answer: I have a rainbow favicon on each page of my website. 

      Your site must include some sort of header.

      Answer: I have a navigation bar on each page of my website. 

      Your site must include some sort of navigation links.

      Answer: Each nav bar on my website links to the appropriate pages. 

      Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. Use comments to note where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. Consider using this to control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).
     
      Answer: I use media queries on each page of my website to re-configure the layout of the page if the width gets below a certain number.
     
      Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
      
      Answer: My site uses many pictures of book covers and the "logo", each alt description is appropriate.

      Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.
      
      Answer: Each page of my website passes the Nu Validator tests without any warnings or errors. Each of my .css files have issues in the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator
      that I was not sure how to fix. My schedule.html and members.html pages have warnings in the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator because I use a table element in each of those. 
      
      Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.
      
      Answer: I use the standard font family and the Gills Sans font family. 
      
      Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, but it must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
      
      Answer: My website has a "getting started" page where the use can enter their name, email, phone number. When the submit button is pressed, it will take the user to a thank you page. 
      
      Your site must include links to external sites.

      Answer: My website includes several links to amazon.

      Your site must be available at https://< your username or your partner's username>.github.io/343-f22-p1
      
      Answer: my site is called https://tladams.github.io/343-f22-p1
      
      In https://< your username or your partner's username >.github.io/343-f22-p1/report.html, write a brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above, and linking to the PDF of your design sketch.


    Professional Practices and Design Quality
      Your site's non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS files must be placed in a directory named css. The PDF files of your design sketch must be placed in a directory named design.
      
      Answer: I have a css folder that contains all my .css files, a design folder that contains all my .html files, and an images folder that contains all images used for the website. 
      
      Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared external stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate external stylesheets.
      
      Answer: I have a similar layout / style for each page, excluding the colors and contents of of the page. 
      
      The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and right-alignment over centeringâ€”as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
      
      Answer: Most of my pages include right- and left-aligned items. 
      
      The content should have adequate and consistent spacing. Text should never bleed against the edge of its containing box.
      
      Answer: All of my text is easily readbale and consistently spaced.
      
      Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs. Use kebab-case (preferred) or camelCase identifiers.
      
      Answer: I mainly use kebab-case identifiers for this project.
      
      Your source code should use semantic and structural elements to support accessible usage. You should also use ARIA features as appropriate. In particular, you must adhere to the Level A recommendations in the WCAG Checklist Links to an external site..
      
      Answer: I use the nav element in each page of my website. 
      
      The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.

      Answer: I follow this design rule, each page of my website is appropriately named, and so are all stylesheets. 

      You should use meaningful comments.
