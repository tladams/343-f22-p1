# project1-web-design

This repository is for my Web Development Project 1. 

For this project, we were allowed creative freedom to create any type of website we wanted, however, it needed to be for someone other than ourselves.
Therefore, I created a website for a fictitious LGBTQ+ book club called Rainbow Reading.

This website contains 6 distinct pages, including a home page, schedule page, book list page, members page, and a sign-up page.
The 6th page is seen when a person "signs up" for the book club, and they press the "Sign up!" button; it is a "Thank you" page for joining the book club.

I hope whoever checks this out likes it!
